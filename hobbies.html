    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>When it comes to hobbies, I honestly didn't really have any at first. I just spent my time, going to work, then the gym, with then going back home and getting ready to do it all over again the following day.</p>
        <p> As time progressed though, I ended up considering the gym as a hobby, which in turn turend into a life style. I also picked up on building PC's since I found it entertaining and such. On the weekends though, thats a different story,</p>
        <p>I'll hop on minecraft with a group of friends, or I'll play Warzone with my brother. If im not doing either of those things, I'll continue my Gundam builds, or read a new light novel I picked up called Solo Leveling.</p>
        <p>Otherwise a night of laser tagging, bowling or arcade gaming is what I enjoy doing as well.</p>
