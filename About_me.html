    <h1>Home-town</h1>
    <p>Like the entry had stated, I'm Arturo, and I'm a 3rd year student here at IIT.</p>
    <p> I'm from a small town called Sandwich, IL. I was born,Raised and even graduated from Sandwich Community High School. It wasnt until 2020, when I had decided to resume my higher education that, I left my home town. Granted it was only about an hour and half away.</p>
    <p>Even then though mile wise that's about 125-140 miles driven a day if i had decided to communte from there.</p>
